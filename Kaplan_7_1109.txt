Are you ready to begin coding your game?
I'm getting somewhat close to begin.

Why or why not?
I've not completely finished my flowchart, but I'm getting close to 
finishing it.

What will be your biggest challenges?
I think the biggest challenge might be coding in a split descion.

Why?
This will be difficult since it'll most likely be more difficult than
everything else.
