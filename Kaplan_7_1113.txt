How will you use while loops in your game? Why?
To make something repeat, like if user keeps on trying to pick up a keycard
to have multiple keycards.

How will you use methods in your game? Why?
I'll use methods to show that the user is in a certain area, like if they're
in the area outside, or in a house.
