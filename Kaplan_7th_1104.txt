What is a method?
   It's a collection of statements that perform an operation when together.

Which methods did you use, and how did you use them in your guessing 
game program?
   I used "private static void playthegame() {" to pick a number 1 through 35.

What is a while loop?
   It repeats statements when given a condition.

How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game?
   I used a while loop to ask the users for their name, a boolean to detect
whether the user won or loss, and a counter to alert the user how many 
guesses they have left.
