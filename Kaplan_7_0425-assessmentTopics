We will have an end of the year assessment.

What are 10 concepts you believe will be covered on the test. Why?

1.Loops - Because we should know if something will repeat.
2.Booleans - For hitpoints if we decide to add or deduct based on 
what we're doing.
3.System.out.println - If we ever want a way to communicate to eachother.
4.Assembly - A lesser language that we should know for lesser programs.
5.Methods - It's parts of a program.
6.public int x ( or y); - This will show coordinates on where a object 
will be.  
7.gc.Fill,gc.Stroke,gc.LineWidth - These are used to make shapes, like what
we did in MethodMaddness.
8.if(counter == 0){ - This shows how many tries or how many more times we can 
do a certain thing.
9.static boolean (Command) - These are used for as like objects or 
interactions.
