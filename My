My project on Method Maddness that I've used to draw a series of pictures.
What I've drawn is a house, tree, the sun and a dark cloud. I don't think
that my picture is the best thing ever, but it's pretty good. My project
isn't complete currently, but it'll soon will be. Later it'll use about 7 
methods most likely, and uses shapes like rectangles,ovals and a line.
