Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
	public Player() throws SlickException {
		SpriteSheet runningSS = new Sprite Sheet {
			"res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
		up = new Animation();
		up.setAutoUpdate(true);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
		up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
^--- This code is giving this sprite sheet a running animation when you go 
upwards.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax, what 
are the skills we were trying to practice?

Memorizing slick syntax is very specific. Rather we should focus on skills 
that have maxiumum return on investment (ROI).

What is an array?
An array can hold a fixed number of values of a single type.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
String[] micheal {"John","Sally","Sue","Stormy"};
int [] myFavoriteNumbers= new int[42];

What is an ArrayList?
An array that can create objects, such as items and enemies.

How do you make an arraylist?
public ArrayList<Enemy> Enemy = new ArrayList();

What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
Healing, win conditions, and enemy arraylists.

What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
An array is static, meaning it has a fixed size, whereas ArrayLists are
dynamic, meaning their size can change.

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
int health =5;
if(playerISHit){
health -=1;
