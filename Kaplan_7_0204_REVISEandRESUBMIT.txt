We will be revising our games so that they are more 'finished'. This will
require revision and retweaking.

Why bother with revising and resubmitting?

We revise our games to make them better, and more clean. This'll make them
better to read, and fix. The point of resubmitting is so we can send you our
updated game that you can play, and probably have a better experiance with.
