The essence of human/higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate
patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.

Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
So that they'll see what needs to be done if they have an error in their code and what
to do about it. They should also be encouraged to learn CS so that they'll understand 
how to understand to do certain things like importing images and giving hitboxes, etc.

What should students learn from CS?
Students in CS should be learning things like booleans, arrays, methods and classes.
