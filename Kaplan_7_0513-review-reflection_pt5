The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays.
Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals,other
students had no recollection. Which were you? Why?
It look somewhat similar, but I still have just as much trouble with this 
just like our previous assignment.
 
Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced
the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)

Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 that 
you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, class 
constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

1.What is an array?
2.Why use while loops in your game?
3.What is the syntax for a 2D or 3D array?
4.How do we call our game in main?
5.What is the syntax for a while loop?
6.Why is it recommended to use .toLowerCase(") with scanner input.
7.How do yo uchange the value for a third value in a one dimensional array?
8.How would you make a simple array of Strings?
9.What values should we pass across methods?
10.How should we use different methods?
