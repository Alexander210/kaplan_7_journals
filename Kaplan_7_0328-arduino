What differences and similarites have you noticed?
1.There is no public class needed for Arduino.

2.Instead of using "public Item healthpotion;" Arduino uses 
"#define Note_C2 64".

3.They both use booleans,int's , and loops.

What code adaptations have you made?
We've changed the different frequencies with the buttons.

What is required for a circuit?
Wires to connect objects to one another with the #define, the proper LED's,
Buzzers if you want to make sound, and a LED screen if you want to project
something.

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
Games like the one featured with Arduino "Simon Says", are pretty similar
with Arduino, they can also work and be made with other games.

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you've learned
from them.
We completed most of the projects, like the LCD screen project, Buzzer project,
etc. We learned quite a bit from them, like why the cord placements matter,and 
the LED lights as well, (Like positive to negative).

Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make.
Our project is based off on a Piano, and to do this we'll make it to be 
played instantly without having to press a button to start it like a game.
We'll even have to change the different frequencies so it'll have different
notes with it.
