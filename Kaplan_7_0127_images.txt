How do you add an image to a slick game?
In a class, you would put something like
Image healthpotion = new Image(
		"res/health_potion.png");

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.]
In the main code, it'll be something like this
	for (Item i : stuff) {
		if (i.isvisible) {
			i.currentImage.draw(i.x, i.y);
