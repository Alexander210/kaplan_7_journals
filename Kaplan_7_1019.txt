I am almost done with my project, I have to finish my essay, and finish 
adding in my methods.

This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods.
What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
I made a house with a blue background with the sun, a tree and a cloud.

Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals
(as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
I noticed it.

Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
Yes, it looks familar.
